I'll attend the Risk Working Group.

In reflection to the podcast, I thought that it seemed like a bunch of people are doing exactly what Dawn had mentioned, they feel a need to justify their own existence, and hence the podcast was born. I personally am of the opinion that open source projects survive because their is a need for them. I believe that using metrics to try to keep projects alive after they should have died, is pointless, and only delays their death.
