# SSO Reflection

I didn't have any problems with the assignment, as I've used
SSO before and everything went relatively smoothly. SSO is an
awesome technology, and it has made it much easier to get consumers
to create an account for a website, as it requires less commitment
as opposed to filling out a sign-up form. The only site I visited to do this assignment was
[this one](https://realpython.com/flask-google-login/#creating-your-own-web-application).



The biggest challenge I encountered in this assignment was the lack of
clear instructions in the directions for the assignment. First, why is the Dex
project included in the assignment instructions? While reading through the assignment,
It was difficult to understand if the Dex Project was part of the assignment, and how to turn it in.
I realized that it seems to have absolutely no relevance to the actual assignment, and was just some food for thought.
From it's appearance the assignment seems to be to download the example, create OAuth credentials in the google API,
and then write the reflection and the goals. It talks about creating an application, but it doesn't specify to actually 
create anything in the assignment section. I'm assuming this will be the next assignment.
I've been wondering this entire semester, if the assignments are intentionally made vague and difficult to understand?
I was thinking that this might be a simulation of what it is like to have a terrible boss in the workplace who doesn't clearly
explain things, and if that has been done intentionally that could be considered valuable to learn.

At the end of the semester, I will have an application that follows wikipedia links, as described in the GOALS.md page.
