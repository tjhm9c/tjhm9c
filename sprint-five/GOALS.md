# Application Purpose

The purpose of the application will be to provide a link to a
Wikipedia article, and check to see if by clicking the first
link on the page consecutively will lead to the wikipedia
article on Philosophy.

[See Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy)

It is said that 97% of all articles on Wikipedia will eventually
lead to the article on Philosophy, by clicking the first link
on the page repeatedly. This application will follow links until
it reaches a dead-end article, or the philosophy article.
(A dead-end article has no outgoing-links or all links it does have
are broken.)

The audience for this app are people who are curious and those who
want to win random bets with their friends who don't believe them while
drunk at a party. *"Hey man, I bet if you name a wikipedia article
I can get to the article on philosophy by clicking page links, no matter
what you name!"*

This application will have an input box for a link to a wikipedia article,
and then will output the path followed to reach the philosophy article.
