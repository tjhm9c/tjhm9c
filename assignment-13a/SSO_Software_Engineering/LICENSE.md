# What License and Why?

I typically would use the MIT license, as I've used it before, and it removes any liability from the project. I've developed an open-source project
that uses this license before, and would likely stick with what I know. There was a point in time when I was developing the project that I did
pretty extensive research on different license's and determined the MIT license best fit my needs.
