# Description:
The only projects I looked at are OAuth and OpenID Connect in combination becuase I have used them before, and they are simple to setup and use.

# Why Choose OAuth in combination with OpenID Connect?
I chose the combination of these because I have used them before.

# How Far I Got
I finished the authentication, I didn't include signing the security certificate.

# Obstacles
The only obstacle I encountered was time, but that was my own fault, as I started the assignment about 2 hours before it was due. Therefore
the documentation is lacking, and the code could be much better written, but it does work.
