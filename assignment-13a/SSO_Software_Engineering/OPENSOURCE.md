# Why Contribute to open source software?

There are many reasons to contribute to open source software, and many reasons to do so as well.

One reason to contribute to open source software is because it can increase hiring prospects, as it shows you program outside of a job.
Another reason to contribute to open source software is because the project you are contributing to can be useful to things you are working on,
and it can also be important to projects you work on at your job. There is also a potential that you may get paid if you become a key member of
an open-source project, enough so that it becomes your job to work on the software.
