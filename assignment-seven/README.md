The Map File no longer functions as intended because the longitude/latitude data used in the API is no longer available.
It used to have dots appear all over the country.

Charts were made using Matplotlib, Plotly, and Pandas.

There is only one JSON file, because each plot was made using different sub-sections of the JSON data. The JSON file is relatively large at nearly 1MB of data.

The Code has been included, with the API-key redacted. The code is poorly written, as all work was stopped on it when the assignment no longer required an implementation, so it never was cleaned up.
