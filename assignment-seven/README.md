The Map File no longer functions as intended because the longitude/latitude data used in the API is no longer available.
It used to have dots appear all over the country.

Charts were made using Matplotlib, Plotly, and Pandas.

There is only one JSON file, because each plot was made using different sub-sections of the JSON data.
